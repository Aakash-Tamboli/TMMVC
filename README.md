# TMMVC
TMMVC is a replica project for learning component based javascript framework like Angular.js

#### Important Note for Self (Aakash) from Past Aakash
Because of personal issues, I stopped this framework but if you read this README.md then I encourage you to start this project again because of 2 reasons.
1) Making Replica of existing technology will sharpen your ground basics like when to create static method, when to use singleton design and so on...
2) If you doing something where front-end(look & feel) is important in your existing work then You must continue this project again, because it will surely benifit you in your work.


# Learned Things
1) there is two method i.e `isEqualsNode` and `isSameNode` these method look similar but `isEqualNode()` method gives true/false based on content but `isSameNode()` method gives true/false based on if both refference variable reffer to single object then true otherwise false (it check both are reffer to same object or not).
